### What I learned

Basic usage of asyc and wait with catch methods

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
    let response = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
    let quote = await response.json()
    return quote
```


### Continued development

The mobile design could still use a bit more work

### Useful resources

- [Asyc/ Await article](https://javascript.info/async-await) - This helped me learn asyc and wait and how to use them.
